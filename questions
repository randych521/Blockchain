1. Compare the difference between account/UTXO based model
   account-based: need to maintain account balance table, but each transaction needs to store less data
   UTXO-based: no need to maintain account balance table; transactions are self-contained, but more space required to store transactions (means longer chain)
2. How to ensure transaction order in account based model?
   In my example I use arbitrary order in the input file as the transaction order.
   In a network blockchain the order would be determined by the validation process.
   The latest added block to the chain will take precedence and all transactions in it are executed in order.
3. What is transaction/block?
   Transactions are trade records we want to store in the blockchain.
   Each block archives several transactions in it for further validations.
4. Why to set block generation time?
   New block needs to be validated by the community and it takes some time.
5. When to update the account balance?
   When a valid transaction is added to the blockchain.
6. When to execute state finalizing?
   Blockchain finalize states when a new validated block is added to the chain and all transactions in it are executed.
7. In our spec, each account has 100 coins as the default balance. What is money minting on blockchain? How to make money?
   Money is rewarded to those contributes computing power to calculate hashes for new added blocks.
